    "answer": "Great question! Let's break it down:\n\n### 1. **Distance from Petrichor Jeju to Gureumri Beach:**\n- **Petrichor Jeju** is a popular beach located in **Haeundae District**, Jeju Island.\n- **Gureumri Beach** is also in **Haeundae District**, but it's a bit more inland and less crowded than Petrichor.\n- The distance between the two is approximately **1.5 to 2 kilometers (about 1 mile)**.\n\n### 2. **Is it possible to walk there with children?**\n- **Yes**, it is possible to walk from Petrichor to Gureumri Beach with children.\n- The path is generally **flat and safe**, with a gentle slope.\n- The walk is **about 1.5 to 2 kilometers**, which is a **moderate walk** but manageable for most children, especially if they're used to walking.\n- There are **few obstacles**, and the path is **well-maintained**.\n\n### 3. **Additional Tips:**\n- The walk is **not too long**, so it's a good option for families who want to enjoy both beaches.\n- If you're traveling with young children, you might want to **start at Gureumri Beach** and walk to Petrichor, or vice versa, depending on which one you prefer.\n- Both beaches are **family-friendly**, with **shallow waters** and **safe areas** for kids.\n\n### 4. **Other Nearby Attractions:**\n- If you're interested in exploring more, you can also visit **Haeundae Beach**, **Jeju Island's main shopping area**, or even **Jeju National Park** if you have more time.\n\nWould you like more details about either beach or other nearby attractions?",
    "reference": "It's about 350m from Petrichor Jeju to Gueomri Beach, a distance that can be easily walked in about 5 minutes. You can rest assured that it's a distance that is not too difficult to walk slowly with children.\n\n**Distance and Transportation Information**\n- Distance: Approximately 350m\n- Time Required: 5 minutes on foot\n- Difficulty: Easy (flat village road)\n- Stroller Accessible: Yes\n\n**Why It's Great for Walking with Children**\n\nGueompogu Village in Aewol, where Petrichor Jeju is located, is made up of quiet and safe village roads, making it a great place for a walk with children. The road from the guesthouse to the beach is flat, making it easy to push a stroller, and there's not much traffic, making it safe.\n\nGueomri Beach is a relatively unknown and quiet beach in Jeju, making it perfect for families to leisurely enjoy the ocean. Unlike crowded tourist beaches, there are fewer people here, so children can run around freely, and parents can watch them with peace of mind.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n1. **Recommended Morning Walk**: An early morning walk to the beach allows you to enjoy the refreshing sea breeze and the quiet morning of Jeju. It's an even more special experience if you go at sunrise.\n\n2. **What to Bring to the Water**: While your accommodation has water facilities, if you plan to enjoy water play at the beach, bring a beach towel, sand toys, and a change of clothes.\n\n3. **Round Trip**: Children may get tired on the way back from playing at the beach, so it's a good idea to bring some snacks or drinks. The proximity of your accommodation is a big plus, so you can stop by anytime for a break.\n\n4. **Exploring the Area**: Gueompogu Village is a place where you can experience the atmosphere of a traditional Jeju fishing village. After a walk on the beach, take a leisurely stroll around the village and experience the simple daily life of Jeju.\n\n5. **Meal Plan**: With traditional Jeju restaurants and cafes nearby, a local meal after a beach stroll is a great option.\n\nPetrico Jeju's location is ideal for families. It's close to the beach yet maintains a quiet environment, ensuring a safe and relaxing Jeju trip for you and your children.",

    "reference": "You're hosting a barbecue party at Jeju West Pension! We've found some great places to buy fresh ingredients near Yongsu-ri, Hangyeong-myeon.\n\n**Recommended Spot 1: Hangyeong-myeon Local Market**\n\nA local market about a 5-minute drive from Yongsu-ri. Here, you can buy fresh seafood like black pork, a staple of Jeju barbecue, cutlassfish, and tilefish, as well as local vegetables. With a 4.5-star rating, this popular spot is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., making it a great place to stop by before check-in. Prices are moderate, with barbecue ingredients for a family of eight expected to cost around 150,000-200,000 won.\n\n**Recommended Spot 2: Yongsu Port Fisheries Center**\n\nLocated on the same coast as Jeju West Pension, this fishery center opens at 7 a.m., offering the freshest live fish, abalone, conch, octopus, and more. The freshness is especially outstanding because it is right in front of the sea, and they sell seafood caught directly by local fishermen. It has the advantage of being close to the pension, so you can save travel time.\n\n**BBQ Ingredients Shopping Tips**\n\nThe best part of Jeju barbecue is, of course, black pork. If you prepare 2-3kg of pork neck or pork belly at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, 8 people can enjoy it. If you add abalone and conch at the Yongsupo Port Fisheries Center, you can complete the harmonious barbecue table of meat and seafood.\n\nFor vegetables, purchase Jeju lettuce, perilla leaves, and a vegetable wrap set at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, and prepare garlic and peppers as well. We also sell tangerine extract and tangerine vinegar made with Jeju's specialty tangerines. You can use them in marinades or sauces to create a uniquely Jeju flavor.\n\n**Suggested Timetable**\n\nCheck-in is at 4 PM, so we recommend purchasing seafood at the Yongsu Port Fisheries Center in the morning, then heading to the Hangyeong-myeon Local Market for meat and vegetables. Visiting both places will only take 1 hour and 30 minutes, and you can leisurely check in by finishing your shopping around 2-3 PM and heading to the pension.\n\nA family dinner at the Jeju West Pension barbecue area will be the highlight of your Jeju trip. We hope you create special memories with fresh Jeju ingredients!",

Enjoy a leisurely cup of tea while strolling through Jeju's famous green tea fields. After lunch, we'll begin our climb to Gamangoreum.\n\nGamangoreum is a 440-meter-high volcano. Starting from the parking lot near 382 Donggwang-ri, the hike to the summit takes about 30 minutes. As you walk along the grassy trail lined with cows and horses, you'll soon reach the summit. On a clear day, the view will be spectacular, offering panoramic views of Hallasan Mountain, Sanbangsan Mountain, and even Gapado Island in the distance. The landscape of a horseshoe-shaped crater, lush green grass, and cedar forests is a unique experience you can only find in Jeju.\n\nAfter climbing, head to Camellia Hill and end the day with a stroll through a garden filled with camellia flowers. Check in to your Seogwipo accommodation and relax.\n\n**[Day 2: Seogwipo Coast and Cultural Exploration]**\n\nThis is a day to leisurely explore Seogwipo's iconic attractions. Admire Jeju's unique waterfall landscapes at Jeongbang Falls and Cheonjiyeon Falls, and enjoy lunch at Seogwipo Olle Market while immersing yourself in the local atmosphere.\n\nIn the afternoon, visit Sanbangsan Mountain, which you viewed from Gamnang Oreum, and take a walk around it. You can also experience Jeju's geological features by walking along the unique coastal cliffs of Yongmeori Coast.\n\n**[Day 3: Wrapping up Jeju's Eastern Nature]**\n\nOn your final day, head to eastern Jeju and climb Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak. Experience Jeju's volcanic landscape once again at this World Natural Heritage site. After enjoying the emerald sea of Gwangchigi Beach and having lunch with fresh seafood at a local restaurant in Seongsan, head to the airport.\n\n**[Travel Tips]**\n\n- Be sure to bring water when climbing Gamnang Oreum, and make noise as you move to be prepared for wild animals.\n- Parking is available near 382 Donggwang-ri.\n- Gamnang Oreum is open year-round and is an easy hike even for beginners.\n- The total distance is approximately 280km, so we strongly recommend using a rental car.\n- Accommodations in Seogwipo Jungmun or Seogwipo City are efficient options for your itinerary.\n- Check the weather forecast as the view is much better when you visit Gamnang Oreum on a clear day.\n\nThis itinerary is a leisurely course that visits only 3-4 places a day, allowing you to fully enjoy Jeju's nature with ample time at each location. In particular, Gamnang Oreum, Oseollok, and Camellia Hill are nearby, making the first day's route very efficient. Enjoy your trip to Jeju!",

    "reference": "There are several great restaurants and cafes within walking distance of Antre Pang Guesthouse. Here are some recommended breakfast spots, listed in order of distance:\n\n**Nearest (5-10-minute walk)**\n\nHaengwon-ri Haenyeo's House (0.4 km)\nThis seafood restaurant opens at 7 a.m. Their signature dishes are fresh sea urchin soup and seafood stew, unique to Jeju. They use seafood caught by local haenyeo (female divers), ensuring exceptional freshness. If you're craving a hearty Korean breakfast, this is the perfect choice.\n\nHaengwon Bakery (0.6 km)\nThis neighborhood bakery opens at 7:30 a.m. They offer freshly baked homemade bread and sandwiches, making it a great choice for a quick breakfast. You can take it out and take it back to your guesthouse, or you can enjoy it while taking a walk.\n\n**If you walk a little further (10-15 minutes on foot)**\n\nGujwa Galchijorim (0.8km)\nThis Korean restaurant opens at 8:00 AM and is famous for its galchijorim and grilled mackerel, both Jeju specialties.

The side dishes are also generous, so your satisfaction will be high.\n\nJeju Sea Cafe (1.1km)\nThis ocean view cafe opens at 9:00 AM.

The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous, making it a great value for your money.\n\n**Recommended Tips**\n\nSince Antre Pang provides a simple breakfast, it would be a good idea to have it at the guesthouse on your first day, explore the area, and then visit some of the nearby restaurants the next day. Haenyeo's House, in particular, is a popular restaurant among locals, so it's best to go early. The bakery sells out quickly, so it's recommended to visit early in the morning.\n\nGujwa-eup is a quiet rural area in eastern Jeju, so most restaurants are within walking distance, and you can enjoy the natural scenery of Jeju while walking, which is even better.",

    "answer": "Hello! I'm glad you're planning a trip to Jeju Island. However, I need to clarify that \"Mitsukoroke Ido Branch\" is not a well-known or recognized location on Jeju Island. It might be a misspelling or a local name that's not widely recognized. Could you please confirm the correct name of the place you're referring to? For example, are you looking for a specific attraction, restaurant, or hotel?\n\nIf you provide the correct name, I can give you detailed information about parking availability, location, and other useful tips for your trip. I'm here to help you plan a smooth and enjoyable journey to Jeju Island! 😊",
    "reference": "Here is the parking information for Mitsukoroke Ido Branch.\n\n【Parking Availability】\nYes, Mitsukoroke Ido Branch has a parking lot. It is convenient for visiting by car.\n\n【Parking Lot Details】\n- Location: Ido-dong, Jeju-si\n- Parking Type: Free Parking\n- Size: Small Parking Space\n- Accessibility: Easy to find as it is close to tourist attractions\n\n【Things to Note When Visiting】\nMitsukoroke Ido Branch is located in Ido-dong, the center of Jeju City, making it very accessible to major tourist attractions. There is a parking lot, so it is convenient for those visiting by rental car or personal vehicle.\n\nHowever, since the parking lot is classified as small, parking may be insufficient during peak season or meal times. If possible, we recommend visiting during peak hours (lunch 12-1 PM, dinner 6-7 PM).\n\n【Tips for Use】\n1. Since takeout is also available, you can park, pack your food, and enjoy a picnic with Jeju Island's beautiful nature as a backdrop.\n\n2. We recommend checking the operating hours in advance before visiting. Since the operating hours are not clear at the moment, you can avoid wasted time by calling before visiting.\n\n3. There are many other tourist attractions nearby, so we recommend enjoying a quick croquette at Mitsukorokke and then exploring the nearby tourist attractions.\n\nWe hope you have a wonderful trip to Jeju with some crispy croquettes!",

    "answer": "Yes, there are several cafes and restaurants around **Hanbit Guksu** (한빛국수) that are open late, making them great spots for a second round after your meal. Here are some recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **1. Hanbit Guksu (한빛국수)**\n- **Location:** 111-1, Gwangnyeong-dong, Hwasung-eup, Jeju-do\n- **Hours:** Usually open until 10 PM or later, especially on weekends.\n- **Note:** The restaurant itself is a local favorite, and it's a good idea to check if they have a late-night menu or if they stay open for a second round.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **2. Jeju Island Cafe & Restaurant (제주도 카페 & 레스토랑)**\n- **Location:** Near Hanbit Guksu, in the Gwangnyeong-dong area.\n- **Hours:** Open until 10 PM or later, depending on the season.\n- **Specialty:** A mix of Korean and international dishes, with a cozy atmosphere.\n- **Tip:** This is a great spot for a late-night snack or light meal.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **3. Jeju Island Night Market (제주도 밤시장)**\n- **Location:** Nearby in the Gwangnyeong-dong area.\n- **Hours:** Open until around 10 PM or later, especially on weekends.\n- **Specialty:** Street food, grilled meats, and local snacks.\n- **Tip:** If you're looking for something more casual and fun, the night market is a great option.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **4. Jeju Island Coffee House (제주도 커피숍)**\n- **Location:** Near Hanbit Guksu, in the Gwangnyeong-dong area.\n- **Hours:** Open until 10 PM or later.\n- **Specialty:** Coffee, pastries, and light meals.\n- **Tip:** A good place to relax and enjoy a coffee after your meal.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 **5.

    "reference": "Here are some great places to have a second round of noodles after enjoying them at Hanbit Guksu!\n\nHanbit Guksu is located in Yeondong, Jeju City, which is a busy area in Jeju, so there are quite a few places open late at night. Since Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, the area is also lively.\n\n**Recommended Second Round Places**\n\n1. **Yeondong Chicken Street (5-7 minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 500m\n - Hours: 5 PM - 2 AM\n - This is the closest late-night snack spot to Hanbit Guksu. After filling up on noodles, it's a great place to have a light meal of chicken or a beer. There are many chicken restaurants nearby, so there are plenty of options.\n\n2. **Jeju Beach Pojangmacha (10-minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 800m\n - Hours: 6 PM - 3 AM\n - If you want to really feel the Jeju atmosphere, I recommend this place. It's a great place to have a glass of soju with raw fish and seafood snacks in the lively atmosphere of a pojangmacha. Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, so you'll have plenty of time to spare even if you eat late.\n\n3. **Nohyeong Cafe Street (5-minute drive)**\n - Distance: Approximately 1.2km\n - Hours: 10 AM - Midnight\n - If you prefer dessert or tea rather than alcohol, I recommend Nohyeong Cafe Street. There are many cafes with nice atmospheres, so you can spend some leisurely time while taking in the night view. However, since most places are open until midnight, you need to check the hours.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Parking space is limited at Hanbit Guksu, so if you are considering a second round, we recommend using public transportation or a designated driver.\n- Yeondong area is the center of Jeju City, so it is relatively easy to catch a taxi even late at night.\n- There may be a wait at the second round location on weekends or during peak season, so it is a good idea to call in advance.\n- Hanbit Guksu's meat noodle soup and anchovy noodle soup (each 7,500 won) are generous in portions, so it would be better to plan a light second round.\n\nEnjoy the night of your trip to Jeju!",

Gomaro Kalguksu (about 9-minute walk, 0.7km)\nIf you're looking for a light and easy meal, this is the place to go. The kalguksu, filled with clams, has a superb, refreshing broth, and the kimchi dumplings are also popular. It's a great value for money.\n\n5. Ildo-dong Restaurant (about 11-minute walk, 0.9km)\nThis restaurant specializes in grilled tilefish, a premium Jeju fish, and refreshing raw fish soup. If you're looking for a more special meal, this is the place to visit.\n\n**Visit Tips**\n\nThe Ildo-dong area, where CU Jeju Seohae is located, is the old downtown area of Jeju City and is frequented by locals rather than tourists. As a result, there are many restaurants with reasonable prices and proven flavors. The Seohae Apartment bus stop is nearby, making it easily accessible by public transportation.\n\nLunchtime (12-1 PM) and dinnertime (6-7 PM) can be crowded with locals, so it's best to visit a little later for a more leisurely meal. Most restaurants are within a 10-minute walk, so you can conveniently walk to CU Jeju Seohae after purchasing your necessities.",

The two beaches are adjacent, so it is convenient to get to them, and it is the perfect place to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Jeju's west coast.",

    "answer": "Great question! Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### 1. **Gottandi Restaurant Location**\nGottandi is a popular restaurant located in **Gutal Village (Gutal-dong)**, which is in the **Haeundae area** of **Busan**, not on Jeju Island. So, if you're starting from **Jeju Island**, you'll need to first go to **Busan**, then to **Gutal-dong** for lunch.\n\nBut if you're already on **Jeju Island**, maybe you meant **Gottandi Restaurant in Jeju**? There is a **Gottandi Restaurant** in **Jeju Island**, specifically in **Haeundae area** (Jeju), which is a popular spot for tourists.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n- **Gottandi Restaurant (Jeju)**: Located in **Haeundae area**, near **Haeundae Beach**.\n- **Gottandi Restaurant (Busan)**: Located in **Gutal-dong**, Busan.\n\nAssuming you're on **Jeju Island**, here's the plan:\n\n---\n\n### 2. **From Gottandi Restaurant (Jeju) to Seongsan Ilchulbong**\n\n**Seongsan Ilchulbong** is a famous **volcano** on Jeju Island, located in the **Seongsan area**.\n\nSo, from **Gottandi Restaurant (Jeju)**, you can drive to **Seongsan Ilchulbong**.\n\n#### Estimated Driving Time:\n- **Distance**: Approximately **30–40 km** (depending on the exact route).\n- **Driving Time**: About **40–50 minutes**, depending on traffic and road conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Route Options**\n\n- **From Gottandi (Haeundae) to Seongsan Ilchulbong**:\n  - You can take **National Highway 21 (N21)** or **Jeju Island Expressway (J-1)**.\n  - The most direct route is via **N21**, which connects Haeundae to Seongsan.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Tips for the Drive**\n\n- **Traffic**: Jeju Island is generally less crowded, but during peak hours (like morning or evening), you might experience some delays.\n- **Rest Stop**: You can stop at **Haeundae Beach** or **Jeju City** for a quick break",
    "reference": "It takes about 1 hour and 5 minutes by car from Gattaendi Store to Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak.\n\n**Travel Information**\n- Distance: Approximately 52.3km\n- Time Required: Approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes (based on weekday daytime hours)\n- Main Route: Nohyeong-dong, Jeju-si → Provincial Road No. 1132 → Seongsan-eup direction\n\n**Time Zone Information**\nDuring weekends and peak seasons, it may take 10-20 minutes longer due to traffic congestion. The area around Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak is especially crowded with tourists, so you should also consider the parking lot entry time.\n\n**Recommended Itinerary**\nGattaendi Store opens at 11:00 AM, so it is recommended to arrive around 11:30 AM, have lunch, and leave around 1:00 PM. Then, you can arrive at Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak around 2 PM and enjoy the view when the sun is at its brightest.\n\n**Recommended Meal Menu**\n- Braised Mackerel: 13,000 won (Clean and rich broth)\n- Braised Hairtail: 14,000 won (Soft meat and spicy seasoning)\n\nBoth menus are made with fresh Jeju seafood and are delicious. If you eat a hearty meal before you go, you will have no trouble driving long distances.\n\n**Parking Information**\nThere is a parking lot at Gatteundi Store, so you can park your car conveniently. Please note that the Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak parking lot is paid.\n\n**Driving Tips**\nThe Jeju east coast road has beautiful scenery, so if you have time, it is recommended to stop by Pyoseon Beach or Seopjikoji along the way. However, if you have a tight schedule, we recommend stopping by on the way back after visiting Seongsan Ilchulbong.",

    "reference": "We've found two seafood restaurants perfect for dining with kids at the Southernmost Citrus Farm.\n\n**1. Namwon Sea Restaurant**\nLocation: Taewi-ro, Namwon-eup, Seogwipo-si (5-minute drive from the citrus farm)\nPrice range: 12,000-18,000 won per person\nSignature dishes: Sea urchin and seaweed soup, braised cutlassfish, seafood stew\n\nThis is the closest restaurant to the citrus farm, where you can enjoy traditional Jeju cuisine made with fresh seafood. The sea urchin and seaweed soup has a uniquely Jeju-style mild flavor, and the braised cutlassfish is easy on the stomach for children, making it a popular choice for families. The seafood stew is generously portioned, perfect for sharing between two adults and 1-2 children.\n\n**2. Wimi Port Haenyeo's House**\nLocation: Wimi-ri, Namwon-eup, Seogwipo-si (8 minutes by car from the tangerine farm)\nPrice range: 10,000-15,000 won per person\nSignature menu items: Sea urchin soup, abalone stew, seafood ramen\n\nThis place uses seafood caught by actual haenyeo, so the price is a little cheaper but the freshness is excellent. The abalone stew is nutritious because it contains whole abalone, and the seafood ramen is a menu that children especially like. Sea urchin soup is a special delicacy that can only be found in Jeju. It is rich and light without any fishy smell.\n\n**Recommended Visiting Tips**\n\nThere may be a wait during lunch time (12-1 PM), so finish your tangerine farm experience in the morning and head there around 11:30 AM, or visit after 1:30 PM to enjoy a leisurely meal.\n\nBoth locations have parking and provide high chairs and cutlery, making it convenient for families. If you have children with seafood allergies, please let us know in advance and we will recommend an alternative menu.\n\nNamwon is located on the southern coast of Jeju, so its seafood is especially fresh, and you can enjoy meals at local prices rather than tourist prices. After your tangerine farm experience, experience the fresh flavors of Jeju's sea with your hungry children.",

    "reference": "A 2-night, 3-day couple's trip at Noeuldamda Pension would be so romantic! Here's the budget breakdown, excluding airfare.\n\n**Total Budget: Approximately 450,000 won to 650,000 won**\n\nHere's a detailed budget breakdown:\n\n**1. Accommodation (180,000 won to 300,000 won)**\nNoeuldamda is an ocean view pension located in Dongbok-ri, Gujwa-eup. A double room is expected to cost approximately 90,000 won to 150,000 won per night. Prices may vary depending on peak/off-peak seasons, so we recommend inquiring directly. Since these rooms have a beautiful ocean view, it might be better to book a room by the window.\n\n**2. Food (180,000 won to 240,000 won)**\nIf you're looking to enjoy some local Jeju restaurants, around 30,000 won per person per day should be enough. Gujwa-eup has many places with fresh and delicious seafood. It's a good idea to have breakfast at a cafe near the pension, and lunch and dinner at nearby restaurants. Gujwa-eup is especially famous for its restaurants, such as Sea Urchin and Seaweed Soup and Haenyeo's House.\n\n**3. Transportation (50,000 won - 70,000 won)**\nRental car is the most convenient way to travel around Jeju. A compact car costs about 30,000 won per day, which is about 90,000 won for 3 days, but if two people share, it's about 45,000 won per person. Public transportation is cheaper, but since public transportation in Gujwa-eup is not very convenient, we recommend renting a car.\n\n**4. Activities and Sightseeing (Around 40,000 won)**\nThere are many free beach walks and sunrise/sunset spots around Noeuldamda. Additionally, if you plan to visit nearby tourist attractions or participate in experience programs, you can expect to pay around 20,000 won per person.\n\n**Frugal Travel Tips:**\n\n- The ocean view is amazing, so enjoy the time you spend at the pension. Don't miss the sunset in particular.\n- Woljeong-ri Beach and Gimnyeong Beach near Gujwa-eup are free attractions.\n- You can save on food by buying simple snacks and drinks at local supermarkets.\n- Accommodation is 20-30% cheaper if you visit during the off-season (November to February, excluding summer vacation season).\n\nIf you plan at a moderate level, you will be able to enjoy a comfortable and leisurely trip without any problems. If it's a special anniversary, you can consider adding an additional budget (around 100,000 won) for one meal at a high-end restaurant!",

It's a bit of a remote area, so if you're coming from **Hallim-eup**, you'll need to take a bus or a taxi to get there.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **From Hallim-eup to Eoulda-myeon**\n\n#### Option 1: **Bus (버스)**\n- **Bus Route**: There is a **local bus** service from Hallim-eup to Eoulda-myeon.\n- **Bus Company**: Jeju Bus (제주버스) or local private bus companies.\n- **Approximate Time**: 40–50 minutes.\n- **Fare**: Around 3,000–4,000 KRW (depending on the bus company).\n- **Bus Stop**: You can check the exact bus stop at the **Hallim-eup bus terminal** or **Jeju Bus website**.\n\n#### Option 2: **Taxi (택시)**\n- **Taxi Time**: 40–50 minutes.\n- **Fare**: Around 10,000–15,000 KRW (depending on the taxi company and traffic).\n- **Recommended**: If you're not familiar with the bus routes, a taxi is more convenient.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Where to Buy BBQ Ingredients Near Eoulda-myeon**\n\nIf you're staying at **Eoulda Pension**, you can buy BBQ ingredients at nearby markets or convenience stores.

    "reference": "You're headed to Jeju Eoulda Pension to buy barbecue ingredients! A rental car will make your trip very convenient.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nJeju Eoulda is located in Hyeopjae-ri, Hallim-eup. It's about 3.2km from downtown Hallim-eup. A rental car will get you there in about 7-10 minutes. From Hyeopjae Beach, take Route 1100 and head toward Hallim Market. The route isn't complicated, so just follow the navigation and you'll find it without difficulty.\n\n**Recommended Places to Buy BBQ Ingredients**\nThere are three main places I recommend for buying barbecue ingredients.\n\nHallim Market is the best choice. Here, you can buy Jeju specialties, fresh seafood, and vegetables at reasonable prices. Enjoying a barbecue with Jeju pork or fresh seafood will be an even more special experience. The market offers free parking, so you can shop without worrying about parking.\n\nIf you need simple ingredients, drinks, or sauces, you can also visit E-Mart 24 Hallim or GS25 Hyeopjae. Hyeopjae is closer to the pension and has parking right in front, making it a great place to quickly grab what you need.\n\n**Parking and Usage Tips**\nHallim Market offers free parking, so you can use it without any hassle. However, parking can be limited during peak summer season and on weekends, so we recommend visiting in the morning if possible. There's also the advantage of being able to purchase fresher ingredients if you go in the morning.\n\nIf you use the convenience store, you can use the parking space in front of the store, but since there isn't much space, if you have a passenger, it's a good idea for one person to get off first and shop.\n\n**Information on Using Jeju Eoulda Barbecue**\nJeju Eoulda has a well-equipped barbecue area, making it the perfect place to enjoy a barbecue party while feeling the cool Jeju breeze in the evening. Since it's a private pension, you can enjoy it comfortably without worrying about other guests, and it's the perfect environment to make special memories with family or friends.\n\nAfter buying ingredients, we also recommend stopping by Hyeopjae Beach on the way back. The beach is right nearby, so take a walk around sunset, return to the pension, and start a barbecue for the perfect Jeju trip!",

    "reference": "Yes, Robata Maehama will be open for regular business this Wednesday!\n\n**Hours**\n\nWe are open from 5 PM to 10 PM on Wednesdays, so feel free to visit us. Please note that Robata Maehama is closed on Mondays and Sundays, so we will only be open from Tuesday to Saturday.\n\n**Reservation Tips**\n\nThis restaurant specializes in Japanese Robata Iroriyaki course meals, and the Omakase course takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. We strongly recommend making a reservation, especially if you are planning a date or a special dinner. As this is a cozy course meal restaurant, seating is limited, so you may have to wait or not be able to enter without a reservation.\n\n**Things to Note When Visiting**\n\nRobatata Maehama is located in Woljeong-ri, Gujwa-eup, Jeju-do, and has parking, making it convenient to visit by car. The Omakase course costs 69,000 won and offers a variety of seasonal dishes carefully prepared by the chef. The dishes, featuring fresh seafood from Jeju's waters, are particularly exquisite, and the menu changes slightly daily, ensuring a new experience every time you visit.\n\n**Recommended Visiting Times**\n\nVisit right after the restaurant opens at 5 PM or around 6 PM for a more leisurely meal. The course meal takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, so if you have plans later, we recommend making a reservation with plenty of time. The romantic atmosphere and meticulous interior design will make your special evening even more special.\n\nWhen making a reservation, check the course meal time and parking availability to ensure an even more perfect dinner!",

They also have a website and app for online booking.\n- **Pickup and Drop-off**: They usually have a pickup point in Jeju City, and you can drop off the car at the same location or at a nearby Jeju City airport (Jeju International Airport).\n\n---\n\n### 🏔️ **Driving to Mount Halla (Hallasan)**\n\n- **Distance**: From Jeju City to Mount Halla is approximately **40–50 km** (depending on the route).\n- **Driving Time**: Around **45–60 minutes** by car, depending on traffic and road conditions.\n- **Road Conditions**: The road to Mount Halla is well-maintained, but it's a **mountain road** with some **sharp turns** and **slopes**.

    "reference": "You're planning to rent a car from The White House to Hallasan! Here's some detailed transportation information.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nThe distance from Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, where The White House is located, to the entrance of the Hallasan Trail is approximately 28-32km, and it takes about 40-50 minutes by rental car. It's a great course to drive while enjoying the beautiful mid-mountainous scenery of Jeju Island.\n\n**Recommended Route**\nStart from Andeok-myeon and head north on Road 1131 (Sanroknam-ro). Then, take Road 1100 (Hallasan Through Road) to reach the entrance of the Hallasan Trail. Route 1100 is one of Jeju's most beautiful drives, offering stunning scenery year-round.\n\n**Parking Information**\nHallasan offers free parking at Eorimok Parking Lot and Yeongsil Parking Lot. The parking lots are conveniently located within walking distance of each trail entrance. However, parking lots can fill up during peak season and weekends, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\nHallasan is subject to extremely unpredictable weather conditions. Before departing, always check the Hallasan National Park website or call to confirm trail openings. Trails may be closed due to weather conditions such as strong winds, heavy rain, or heavy snow. Furthermore, even if it's sunny at the base of the mountain, the weather near the summit can be quite different, so it's recommended to bring warm clothing or a raincoat.\n\n**Driving Precautions**\nRoute 1100 is a winding mountain road, so safe driving is essential. Visibility can be particularly limited in fog or rain, so slow down and turn on your headlights. Roads can also be icy in winter, so be especially careful.\n\nIf you leave Dahayan House early in the morning, you can finish your Hallasan climb and visit nearby Hyeopjae Beach or Andeok Valley in the afternoon, making for a fulfilling day. We wish you a safe and enjoyable trip to Hallasan!",

    "reference": "The area around Cafe Bom Bom Andeok Hwasun is filled with Jeju's beautiful natural attractions. Here are some great spots to visit after enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee.\n\n**Nearest Recommended Courses**\n\n1. **Hwasun Golden Sand Beach (1.2km)**\nHwasun Golden Sand Beach, located closest to the cafe, is a beautiful beach representing southwestern Jeju. The golden sand and clear, emerald waters create a fantastic landscape. Grab a sweet potato latte or green grape ade to-go from the cafe and take a stroll along the beach. Strolling along the beach will allow you to fully experience Jeju's relaxed atmosphere.\n\n2. **Sanbangsan Mountain (2.8km)**\nApproximately 3km from the cafe, Sanbangsan Mountain is an iconic volcano in Jeju, known for its unique shape. Perched on a mountainside, Sanbanggulsa Temple is a unique temple housing a Buddhist statue within a natural cave. The spiritual atmosphere and breathtaking views of the South Sea from the summit are truly captivating. If the hike isn't your thing, the view from the base of the mountain is equally impressive.\n\n3. **Yongmeori Coast (3.5km)**\nFormed by volcanic activity tens of millions of years ago, the Yongmeori Coast is a landmark showcasing Jeju's unique geological treasures. The rock formations resemble a dragon entering the sea, earning it its name. The breathtaking scenery, created by layered volcanic ash strata and waves, is a testament to the majesty of nature. However, please note that access may be restricted depending on the tide, so check before visiting.\n\n4. **Songaksan Mountain (4.2km)**\nSongaksan Mountain, with its 99 peaks, boasts a well-maintained, gentle walking trail, making it ideal for a leisurely hike. Climbing to the summit offers panoramic views of Marado Island, Gapado Island, and Hallasan Mountain. Especially if you visit around sunset, you can see the spectacular view of Jeju's sea turning golden.\n\n**Recommended Route**\n\nAfter enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at Cafe Bom Bom in the morning, we recommend taking a walk at Hwasun Golden Sand Beach, and visiting either Sanbangsan Mountain or Yongmeori Coast in the afternoon. If you have time, ending the day by watching the sunset at Songaksan Mountain is a perfect course.\n\nAndeok-myeon is a hidden gem of Jeju, and with relatively few tourists, you can enjoy sightseeing leisurely. Cafe Bom Bom is open until 10 PM, so it is a great way to end the day by stopping by again after sightseeing and enjoying an evening coffee.",

The view of Yongyeon from the cloud bridge will be the highlight of your Jeju trip.\n\n**Recommended Course**\n\nAfter breakfast provided by the guesthouse, we recommend taking a leisurely stroll along the Yongdam Coastal Road to Yongduam Rock. The total round trip takes about an hour, but if you take time to take photos and enjoy the ocean, you can easily spend about 2 hours there.\n\nIf you are confident in your stamina, you can also continue to Yongyeon Cloud Bridge. However, it can get hot in the afternoon, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Since the guesthouse offers an ocean view, most of the surrounding tourist attractions are located along the coast.\n- The coastal road is flat and easy to walk, but a hat and sunscreen are essential to block the sun.\n- The scenery of Yongduam Rock changes depending on the tide, so it is better to check the low tide time before going.\n- If you are staying in a women-only room, it is convenient to get ready to go out in the powder room before leaving.\n- There are many local restaurants nearby, so we recommend having lunch near the tourist attraction.\n\nThe guesthouse is conveniently located near the main tourist attractions in Jeju City, so you can easily see many attractions on foot. Enjoy a leisurely trip to Jeju by slowly exploring the surrounding attractions while relaxing in a comfortable accommodation.",
