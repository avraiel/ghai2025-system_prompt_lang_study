    "reference": "You're hosting a barbecue party at Jeju West Pension! We've found some great places to buy fresh ingredients near Yongsu-ri, Hangyeong-myeon.\n\n**Recommended Spot 1: Hangyeong-myeon Local Market**\n\nA local market about a 5-minute drive from Yongsu-ri. Here, you can buy fresh seafood like black pork, a staple of Jeju barbecue, cutlassfish, and tilefish, as well as local vegetables. With a 4.5-star rating, this popular spot is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., making it a great place to stop by before check-in. Prices are moderate, with barbecue ingredients for a family of eight expected to cost around 150,000-200,000 won.\n\n**Recommended Spot 2: Yongsu Port Fisheries Center**\n\nLocated on the same coast as Jeju West Pension, this fishery center opens at 7 a.m., offering the freshest live fish, abalone, conch, octopus, and more. The freshness is especially outstanding because it is right in front of the sea, and they sell seafood caught directly by local fishermen. It has the advantage of being close to the pension, so you can save travel time.\n\n**BBQ Ingredients Shopping Tips**\n\nThe best part of Jeju barbecue is, of course, black pork. If you prepare 2-3kg of pork neck or pork belly at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, 8 people can enjoy it. If you add abalone and conch at the Yongsupo Port Fisheries Center, you can complete the harmonious barbecue table of meat and seafood.\n\nFor vegetables, purchase Jeju lettuce, perilla leaves, and a vegetable wrap set at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, and prepare garlic and peppers as well. We also sell tangerine extract and tangerine vinegar made with Jeju's specialty tangerines. You can use them in marinades or sauces to create a uniquely Jeju flavor.\n\n**Suggested Timetable**\n\nCheck-in is at 4 PM, so we recommend purchasing seafood at the Yongsu Port Fisheries Center in the morning, then heading to the Hangyeong-myeon Local Market for meat and vegetables. Visiting both places will only take 1 hour and 30 minutes, and you can leisurely check in by finishing your shopping around 2-3 PM and heading to the pension.\n\nA family dinner at the Jeju West Pension barbecue area will be the highlight of your Jeju trip. We hope you create special memories with fresh Jeju ingredients!",

    "answer": "There are several great places to visit after Hanbit Guksu, especially those open late. Here are some of the best options in the area.\n\n**Recommended Places to Visit After Hanbit Guksu**\n\n1. **Jeju Island Cafe Street (0.8km)**\n - This is the closest place to Hanbit Guksu\n - It's a great place to visit after a hearty meal of Hanbit Guksu\n - It's open from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, so you can visit late in the evening\n - There are many cafes with a great atmosphere, making it a great place to relax\n - It's a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee or dessert after a meal\n\n2. **Jeju Island Traditional Restaurant Street (1.2km)**\n - This is a traditional restaurant street where you can experience Jeju's local cuisine\n - It's open from 11:00 AM to 10:00 PM, so you can visit late in the evening\n - It's a great place to visit after a meal of Hanbit Guksu\n - You can enjoy a variety of traditional Jeju dishes\n\n3. **Jeju Island Night Market (1.5km)**\n - This is a night market open from 6:00 PM to 1:00 AM\n - It's a great place to visit after Hanbit Guksu\n - You can enjoy a variety of snacks and desserts\n - It's a great place to visit late at night\n\n**Visit Tips**\n\nHanbit Guksu is open from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, so you can visit late in the evening. If you want to enjoy a second round, we recommend visiting the Jeju Island Cafe Street or Jeju Island Traditional Restaurant Street after your meal. The Jeju Island Night Market is also a great option if you want to visit late at night.\n\nThe area around Hanbit Guksu is a great place to visit with friends or family, and there are many great restaurants and cafes to choose from. Enjoy a delicious meal of Hanbit Guksu and then enjoy a leisurely evening at a cafe or restaurant!",
    "reference": "Here are some great places to have a second round of noodles after enjoying them at Hanbit Guksu!\n\nHanbit Guksu is located in Yeondong, Jeju City, which is a busy area in Jeju, so there are quite a few places open late at night. Since Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, the area is also lively.\n\n**Recommended Second Round Places**\n\n1. **Yeondong Chicken Street (5-7 minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 500m\n - Hours: 5 PM - 2 AM\n - This is the closest late-night snack spot to Hanbit Guksu. After filling up on noodles, it's a great place to have a light meal of chicken or a beer. There are many chicken restaurants nearby, so there are plenty of options.\n\n2. **Jeju Beach Pojangmacha (10-minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 800m\n - Hours: 6 PM - 3 AM\n - If you want to really feel the Jeju atmosphere, I recommend this place. It's a great place to have a glass of soju with raw fish and seafood snacks in the lively atmosphere of a pojangmacha. Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, so you'll have plenty of time to spare even if you eat late.\n\n3. **Nohyeong Cafe Street (5-minute drive)**\n - Distance: Approximately 1.2km\n - Hours: 10 AM - Midnight\n - If you prefer dessert or tea rather than alcohol, I recommend Nohyeong Cafe Street. There are many cafes with nice atmospheres, so you can spend some leisurely time while taking in the night view. However, since most places are open until midnight, you need to check the hours.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Parking space is limited at Hanbit Guksu, so if you are considering a second round, we recommend using public transportation or a designated driver.\n- Yeondong area is the center of Jeju City, so it is relatively easy to catch a taxi even late at night.\n- There may be a wait at the second round location on weekends or during peak season, so it is a good idea to call in advance.\n- Hanbit Guksu's meat noodle soup and anchovy noodle soup (each 7,500 won) are generous in portions, so it would be better to plan a light second round.\n\nEnjoy the night of your trip to Jeju!",

If you have children with seafood allergies, please let us know in advance and we will recommend an alternative menu.\n\nNamwon is located on the southern coast of Jeju, so its seafood is especially fresh, and you can enjoy meals at local prices rather than tourist prices. After your tangerine farm experience, experience the fresh flavors of Jeju's sea with your hungry children.",

Accommodation (180,000 won to 300,000 won)**\nNoeuldamda is an ocean view pension located in Dongbok-ri, Gujwa-eup. A double room is expected to cost approximately 90,000 won to 150,000 won per night. Prices may vary depending on peak/off-peak seasons, so we recommend inquiring directly. Since these rooms have a beautiful ocean view, it might be better to book a room by the window.\n\n**2. Food (180,000 won to 240,000 won)**\nIf you're looking to enjoy some local Jeju restaurants, around 30,000 won per person per day should be enough.

A compact car costs about 30,000 won per day, which is about 90,000 won for 3 days, but if two people share, it's about 45,000 won per person. Public transportation is cheaper, but since public transportation in Gujwa-eup is not very convenient, we recommend renting a car.\n\n**4. Activities and Sightseeing (Around 40,000 won)**\nThere are many free beach walks and sunrise/sunset spots around Noeuldamda. Additionally, if you plan to visit nearby tourist attractions or participate in experience programs, you can expect to pay around 20,000 won per person.\n\n**Frugal Travel Tips:**\n\n- The ocean view is amazing, so enjoy the time you spend at the pension. Don't miss the sunset in particular.\n- Woljeong-ri Beach and Gimnyeong Beach near Gujwa-eup are free attractions.\n- You can save on food by buying simple snacks and drinks at local supermarkets.\n- Accommodation is 20-30% cheaper if you visit during the off-season (November to February, excluding summer vacation season).\n\nIf you plan at a moderate level, you will be able to enjoy a comfortable and leisurely trip without any problems. If it's a special anniversary, you can consider adding an additional budget (around 100,000 won) for one meal at a high-end restaurant!",

    "reference": "You're headed to Jeju Eoulda Pension to buy barbecue ingredients! A rental car will make your trip very convenient.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nJeju Eoulda is located in Hyeopjae-ri, Hallim-eup. It's about 3.2km from downtown Hallim-eup. A rental car will get you there in about 7-10 minutes. From Hyeopjae Beach, take Route 1100 and head toward Hallim Market. The route isn't complicated, so just follow the navigation and you'll find it without difficulty.\n\n**Recommended Places to Buy BBQ Ingredients**\nThere are three main places I recommend for buying barbecue ingredients.\n\nHallim Market is the best choice. Here, you can buy Jeju specialties, fresh seafood, and vegetables at reasonable prices. Enjoying a barbecue with Jeju pork or fresh seafood will be an even more special experience. The market offers free parking, so you can shop without worrying about parking.\n\nIf you need simple ingredients, drinks, or sauces, you can also visit E-Mart 24 Hallim or GS25 Hyeopjae. Hyeopjae is closer to the pension and has parking right in front, making it a great place to quickly grab what you need.\n\n**Parking and Usage Tips**\nHallim Market offers free parking, so you can use it without any hassle. However, parking can be limited during peak summer season and on weekends, so we recommend visiting in the morning if possible. There's also the advantage of being able to purchase fresher ingredients if you go in the morning.\n\nIf you use the convenience store, you can use the parking space in front of the store, but since there isn't much space, if you have a passenger, it's a good idea for one person to get off first and shop.\n\n**Information on Using Jeju Eoulda Barbecue**\nJeju Eoulda has a well-equipped barbecue area, making it the perfect place to enjoy a barbecue party while feeling the cool Jeju breeze in the evening. Since it's a private pension, you can enjoy it comfortably without worrying about other guests, and it's the perfect environment to make special memories with family or friends.\n\nAfter buying ingredients, we also recommend stopping by Hyeopjae Beach on the way back. The beach is right nearby, so take a walk around sunset, return to the pension, and start a barbecue for the perfect Jeju trip!",

We strongly recommend making a reservation, especially if you are planning a date or a special dinner. As this is a cozy course meal restaurant, seating is limited, so you may have to wait or not be able to enter without a reservation.\n\n**Things to Note When Visiting**\n\nRobatata Maehama is located in Woljeong-ri, Gujwa-eup, Jeju-do, and has parking, making it convenient to visit by car.

The course meal takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, so if you have plans later, we recommend making a reservation with plenty of time. The romantic atmosphere and meticulous interior design will make your special evening even more special.\n\nWhen making a reservation, check the course meal time and parking availability to ensure an even more perfect dinner!",

Here's some detailed transportation information.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nThe distance from Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, where The White House is located, to the entrance of the Hallasan Trail is approximately 28-32km, and it takes about 40-50 minutes by rental car. It's a great course to drive while enjoying the beautiful mid-mountainous scenery of Jeju Island.\n\n**Recommended Route**\nStart from Andeok-myeon and head north on Road 1131 (Sanroknam-ro). Then, take Road 1100 (Hallasan Through Road) to reach the entrance of the Hallasan Trail. Route 1100 is one of Jeju's most beautiful drives, offering stunning scenery year-round.\n\n**Parking Information**\nHallasan offers free parking at Eorimok Parking Lot and Yeongsil Parking Lot. The parking lots are conveniently located within walking distance of each trail entrance. However, parking lots can fill up during peak season and weekends, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\nHallasan is subject to extremely unpredictable weather conditions. Before departing, always check the Hallasan National Park website or call to confirm trail openings. Trails may be closed due to weather conditions such as strong winds, heavy rain, or heavy snow. Furthermore, even if it's sunny at the base of the mountain, the weather near the summit can be quite different, so it's recommended to bring warm clothing or a raincoat.\n\n**Driving Precautions**\nRoute 1100 is a winding mountain road, so safe driving is essential. Visibility can be particularly limited in fog or rain, so slow down and turn on your headlights. Roads can also be icy in winter, so be especially careful.\n\nIf you leave Dahayan House early in the morning, you can finish your Hallasan climb and visit nearby Hyeopjae Beach or Andeok Valley in the afternoon, making for a fulfilling day. We wish you a safe and enjoyable trip to Hallasan!",

It's a great place to take a drive and enjoy the scenery.\n\n**Visit Tips**\n\nCafe Bom Bom is open from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, so you can visit leisurely. It's a great place to visit in the morning and enjoy a cup of coffee while taking in the ocean view, or in the evening and enjoy a cup of coffee while watching the sunset.\n\nThe cafe is especially popular with locals, so it can be crowded during peak season. We recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to enjoy a more leisurely time.\n\nThe surrounding area is also home to various tourist attractions, so we recommend planning a day trip to Andeok Hwasun. It's a great place to enjoy a leisurely day of sightseeing and coffee.",
    "reference": "The area around Cafe Bom Bom Andeok Hwasun is filled with Jeju's beautiful natural attractions. Here are some great spots to visit after enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee.\n\n**Nearest Recommended Courses**\n\n1. **Hwasun Golden Sand Beach (1.2km)**\nHwasun Golden Sand Beach, located closest to the cafe, is a beautiful beach representing southwestern Jeju. The golden sand and clear, emerald waters create a fantastic landscape. Grab a sweet potato latte or green grape ade to-go from the cafe and take a stroll along the beach. Strolling along the beach will allow you to fully experience Jeju's relaxed atmosphere.\n\n2. **Sanbangsan Mountain (2.8km)**\nApproximately 3km from the cafe, Sanbangsan Mountain is an iconic volcano in Jeju, known for its unique shape. Perched on a mountainside, Sanbanggulsa Temple is a unique temple housing a Buddhist statue within a natural cave. The spiritual atmosphere and breathtaking views of the South Sea from the summit are truly captivating. If the hike isn't your thing, the view from the base of the mountain is equally impressive.\n\n3. **Yongmeori Coast (3.5km)**\nFormed by volcanic activity tens of millions of years ago, the Yongmeori Coast is a landmark showcasing Jeju's unique geological treasures. The rock formations resemble a dragon entering the sea, earning it its name. The breathtaking scenery, created by layered volcanic ash strata and waves, is a testament to the majesty of nature. However, please note that access may be restricted depending on the tide, so check before visiting.\n\n4. **Songaksan Mountain (4.2km)**\nSongaksan Mountain, with its 99 peaks, boasts a well-maintained, gentle walking trail, making it ideal for a leisurely hike. Climbing to the summit offers panoramic views of Marado Island, Gapado Island, and Hallasan Mountain. Especially if you visit around sunset, you can see the spectacular view of Jeju's sea turning golden.\n\n**Recommended Route**\n\nAfter enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at Cafe Bom Bom in the morning, we recommend taking a walk at Hwasun Golden Sand Beach, and visiting either Sanbangsan Mountain or Yongmeori Coast in the afternoon. If you have time, ending the day by watching the sunset at Songaksan Mountain is a perfect course.\n\nAndeok-myeon is a hidden gem of Jeju, and with relatively few tourists, you can enjoy sightseeing leisurely. Cafe Bom Bom is open until 10 PM, so it is a great way to end the day by stopping by again after sightseeing and enjoying an evening coffee.",

The view of Yongyeon from the cloud bridge will be the highlight of your Jeju trip.\n\n**Recommended Course**\n\nAfter breakfast provided by the guesthouse, we recommend taking a leisurely stroll along the Yongdam Coastal Road to Yongduam Rock. The total round trip takes about an hour, but if you take time to take photos and enjoy the ocean, you can easily spend about 2 hours there.\n\nIf you are confident in your stamina, you can also continue to Yongyeon Cloud Bridge. However, it can get hot in the afternoon, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Since the guesthouse offers an ocean view, most of the surrounding tourist attractions are located along the coast.\n- The coastal road is flat and easy to walk, but a hat and sunscreen are essential to block the sun.\n- The scenery of Yongduam Rock changes depending on the tide, so it is better to check the low tide time before going.\n- If you are staying in a women-only room, it is convenient to get ready to go out in the powder room before leaving.\n- There are many local restaurants nearby, so we recommend having lunch near the tourist attraction.\n\nThe guesthouse is conveniently located near the main tourist attractions in Jeju City, so you can easily see many attractions on foot. Enjoy a leisurely trip to Jeju by slowly exploring the surrounding attractions while relaxing in a comfortable accommodation.",
