    "question_text": "How far is Petrichor Jeju from Gureumri Beach? Is it possible to walk there with children?",
    "answer": "Petrichor Jeju is approximately 4 to 5 kilometers from Gureumri Beach, depending on the specific route taken. Walking this distance with children is possible, but it may take around 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on your pace.\n\nHowever, considering the distance and the potential for uneven or busy roads, it might be more comfortable to use a car or local transportation like a taxi or bus to get between Gureumri Beach and Petrichor Jeju. This way, you and your children can travel comfortably and safely.",
    "reference": "It's about 350m from Petrichor Jeju to Gueomri Beach, a distance that can be easily walked in about 5 minutes. You can rest assured that it's a distance that is not too difficult to walk slowly with children.\n\n**Distance and Transportation Information**\n- Distance: Approximately 350m\n- Time Required: 5 minutes on foot\n- Difficulty: Easy (flat village road)\n- Stroller Accessible: Yes\n\n**Why It's Great for Walking with Children**\n\nGueompogu Village in Aewol, where Petrichor Jeju is located, is made up of quiet and safe village roads, making it a great place for a walk with children. The road from the guesthouse to the beach is flat, making it easy to push a stroller, and there's not much traffic, making it safe.\n\nGueomri Beach is a relatively unknown and quiet beach in Jeju, making it perfect for families to leisurely enjoy the ocean. Unlike crowded tourist beaches, there are fewer people here, so children can run around freely, and parents can watch them with peace of mind.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n1. **Recommended Morning Walk**: An early morning walk to the beach allows you to enjoy the refreshing sea breeze and the quiet morning of Jeju. It's an even more special experience if you go at sunrise.\n\n2. **What to Bring to the Water**: While your accommodation has water facilities, if you plan to enjoy water play at the beach, bring a beach towel, sand toys, and a change of clothes.\n\n3. **Round Trip**: Children may get tired on the way back from playing at the beach, so it's a good idea to bring some snacks or drinks. The proximity of your accommodation is a big plus, so you can stop by anytime for a break.\n\n4. **Exploring the Area**: Gueompogu Village is a place where you can experience the atmosphere of a traditional Jeju fishing village. After a walk on the beach, take a leisurely stroll around the village and experience the simple daily life of Jeju.\n\n5. **Meal Plan**: With traditional Jeju restaurants and cafes nearby, a local meal after a beach stroll is a great option.\n\nPetrico Jeju's location is ideal for families. It's close to the beach yet maintains a quiet environment, ensuring a safe and relaxing Jeju trip for you and your children.",

    "answer": "Yongsu-ri, Hangyeong-myeon, is a lovely area in Jeju, and while there may not be many restaurants directly in Yongsu-ri specializing in barbecue ingredients, I can recommend some nearby places where you can buy fresh ingredients or enjoy barbecue.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Local Markets in Hangyeong-myeon:**  \n   - **Hangyeong Market**: A traditional market where you can find fresh seafood, meats, and vegetables suitable for barbecue. It’s a great place to buy ingredients directly from local vendors.\n\n2. **Specialty Meat Shops:**  \n   - **Jeju Black Pork Shops**: Look for local shops selling Jeju black pork, famous for its quality and flavor. Many of these shops also sell meat for takeout or have small eateries.\n\n3. **Nearby Restaurants with Takeout Options:**  \n   - Some local barbecue restaurants may offer takeout or sell raw meat for you to prepare at your accommodation. It’s worth asking at places like **Hangyeong Haejangguk** or similar local eateries.\n\n**Additional Tip:**  \nIf you’re willing to travel a bit, visiting **Jeju City** or **Seogwipo** markets can give you a wider selection of fresh ingredients for barbecue.\n\nWould you like me to find specific shops or markets with contact details?",
    "reference": "You're hosting a barbecue party at Jeju West Pension! We've found some great places to buy fresh ingredients near Yongsu-ri, Hangyeong-myeon.\n\n**Recommended Spot 1: Hangyeong-myeon Local Market**\n\nA local market about a 5-minute drive from Yongsu-ri. Here, you can buy fresh seafood like black pork, a staple of Jeju barbecue, cutlassfish, and tilefish, as well as local vegetables. With a 4.5-star rating, this popular spot is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., making it a great place to stop by before check-in. Prices are moderate, with barbecue ingredients for a family of eight expected to cost around 150,000-200,000 won.\n\n**Recommended Spot 2: Yongsu Port Fisheries Center**\n\nLocated on the same coast as Jeju West Pension, this fishery center opens at 7 a.m., offering the freshest live fish, abalone, conch, octopus, and more. The freshness is especially outstanding because it is right in front of the sea, and they sell seafood caught directly by local fishermen. It has the advantage of being close to the pension, so you can save travel time.\n\n**BBQ Ingredients Shopping Tips**\n\nThe best part of Jeju barbecue is, of course, black pork. If you prepare 2-3kg of pork neck or pork belly at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, 8 people can enjoy it. If you add abalone and conch at the Yongsupo Port Fisheries Center, you can complete the harmonious barbecue table of meat and seafood.\n\nFor vegetables, purchase Jeju lettuce, perilla leaves, and a vegetable wrap set at the Hangyeong-myeon local market, and prepare garlic and peppers as well. We also sell tangerine extract and tangerine vinegar made with Jeju's specialty tangerines. You can use them in marinades or sauces to create a uniquely Jeju flavor.\n\n**Suggested Timetable**\n\nCheck-in is at 4 PM, so we recommend purchasing seafood at the Yongsu Port Fisheries Center in the morning, then heading to the Hangyeong-myeon Local Market for meat and vegetables. Visiting both places will only take 1 hour and 30 minutes, and you can leisurely check in by finishing your shopping around 2-3 PM and heading to the pension.\n\nA family dinner at the Jeju West Pension barbecue area will be the highlight of your Jeju trip. We hope you create special memories with fresh Jeju ingredients!",

From there, you can enjoy a leisurely stroll around the Seongsan Ilchulbong area, which features beautiful coastal views and scenic walking paths. \n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a more relaxed walk closer to East Forest itself, you might explore the **Jeju Olle Trail** routes that pass through the eastern part of Jeju, offering scenic coastal walks and nature experiences.\n\nWould you like directions to these spots or recommendations for a specific type of walk?",
    "reference": "There are several places near East Forest that are great for a light walk before dinner. I'll tell you about some recommended spots and tips for different situations.\n\n**Nearest walking course**\n\n1. Jongdal-ri Coastal Road (about 7 minutes on foot)\n- Distance: About 0.5km from East Forest\n- A walking path that follows the beautiful eastern coastline of Jeju\n- The ocean views are truly beautiful, and the flat path makes for an easy walk\n- A perfect course for a light 20-30 minute stroll and enjoying the sea breeze\n\n2. Jongdal-ri Beach (about 10 minutes on foot)\n- Distance: About 0.8km\n- A quiet and secluded beach\n- Great for taking pictures, and you can take a leisurely stroll while listening to the sound of the waves\n- A perfect distance for a light stroll before dinner\n\n3. Jimibong Trekking Course (about 15 minutes on foot)\n- Distance: about 1.2km\n- It's a light trekking course with a low incline\n- It takes about 30-40 minutes round trip to the summit, so I recommend it if you have time\n- The view of the ocean and eastern Jeju from the summit is really great\n\n**Recommendations depending on the situation**\n\nIf you have about 30 minutes: Take a leisurely round trip walk along the Jongdal-ri coastal road. It's flat, so it's comfortable, and you can enjoy the ocean view.\n\nIf you have more than an hour: I recommend the Jimibong Trekking Course. It's a little exercise, and the view from the summit will make you feel even better before a meal.\n\nIf your goal is to take pictures: Either Jongdal-ri Beach or the coastal road are good. Especially on days with good weather, you can take a great commemorative shot with the emerald sea.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- East Forest has its own parking lot, so you can leave your car at the restaurant.\n- There is a parking lot that can accommodate large vehicles, so it is convenient.\n- East Forest opens at 11:00 AM, so it is a good idea to come early and have a meal as soon as it opens after a walk.\n- It will be an even more special experience to come back after a walk and enjoy a meal while looking at the sea and sunset through the large glass windows.\n- Don't forget to get the free garlic bread when you order one menu per person.\n\nIt is open 365 days a year, so you can visit anytime. We hope you enjoy a leisurely trip to Jeju Island, enjoying a meal and a walk together.",

    "answer": "Hangyeong-myeon in Jeju City is known for its local eateries, but finding specific places that serve hangover soup (known as \"haejangguk\" in Korean) early in the morning can be a bit challenging, as many restaurants open later in the day.\n\nHowever, in Jeju City and nearby areas, some traditional Korean restaurants or local markets may serve hangover soup early in the morning, especially those catering to locals and fishermen who start their day early.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Local Market Stalls or Small Restaurants:**  \n   - Some market stalls in Jeju City or near the port area open early and may serve haejangguk.  \n   - Prices typically range from **₩5,000 to ₩10,000** per bowl.\n\n2. **24-hour or Early-morning Restaurants:**  \n   - While not specific to Hangyeong-myeon, you might find some 24-hour eateries in Jeju City that serve hangover soup.  \n   - These are usually casual and affordable, with prices around **₩5,000 to ₩8,000**.\n\n**Tip:**  \nSince Hangyeong-myeon is more rural and known for its scenic beauty, it might be better to look for options in Jeju City or Jeju Port area for early-morning hangover soup.\n\nWould you like me to recommend specific restaurants or markets in Jeju City that are known for early-morning service?",

The broth, made with fresh ingredients, has a spicy yet deep flavor, and a light yet savory flavor. This haejangguk is made with such care that you can feel the nature of Jeju Island the moment you take a spoonful.\n\nIt tastes even better when served with charcoal-grilled meat, so if you have time, we recommend ordering both.\n\n**Convenience Facilities**\n- Parking is available, making it convenient for those arriving by car\n- Zero Pay service allows for various payment methods\n\n**Visit Tips**\nWe close at 3:30 PM, so it may be difficult to visit after lunch time. We recommend visiting late in the morning or early lunch time. While exploring the Hangyeong-myeon area during your Jeju trip, it would be great to warm up your body and soul with a bowl of warm haejangguk.\n\nIf you want to taste Jeju's authentic haejangguk, try Inseol Haejangguk and experience the unique taste of Jeju's haejangguk!",

    "reference": "There are several great restaurants and cafes within walking distance of Antre Pang Guesthouse. Here are some recommended breakfast spots, listed in order of distance:\n\n**Nearest (5-10-minute walk)**\n\nHaengwon-ri Haenyeo's House (0.4 km)\nThis seafood restaurant opens at 7 a.m. Their signature dishes are fresh sea urchin soup and seafood stew, unique to Jeju. They use seafood caught by local haenyeo (female divers), ensuring exceptional freshness. If you're craving a hearty Korean breakfast, this is the perfect choice.\n\nHaengwon Bakery (0.6 km)\nThis neighborhood bakery opens at 7:30 a.m. They offer freshly baked homemade bread and sandwiches, making it a great choice for a quick breakfast. You can take it out and take it back to your guesthouse, or you can enjoy it while taking a walk.\n\n**If you walk a little further (10-15 minutes on foot)**\n\nGujwa Galchijorim (0.8km)\nThis Korean restaurant opens at 8:00 AM and is famous for its galchijorim and grilled mackerel, both Jeju specialties. If you want to experience local food during your trip to Jeju Island, this is recommended. The side dishes are also generous, so your satisfaction will be high.\n\nJeju Sea Cafe (1.1km)\nThis ocean view cafe opens at 9:00 AM.

It would be great to visit when you want to enjoy a late breakfast or brunch.\n\nDongbok-ri Noodle House (1.3km)\nThis noodle restaurant is only open from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM. Jeju's signature dishes are meat noodle soup and bibim noodles, which are must-eats on your trip to Jeju Island. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous, making it a great value for your money.\n\n**Recommended Tips**\n\nSince Antre Pang provides a simple breakfast, it would be a good idea to have it at the guesthouse on your first day, explore the area, and then visit some of the nearby restaurants the next day. Haenyeo's House, in particular, is a popular restaurant among locals, so it's best to go early. The bakery sells out quickly, so it's recommended to visit early in the morning.\n\nGujwa-eup is a quiet rural area in eastern Jeju, so most restaurants are within walking distance, and you can enjoy the natural scenery of Jeju while walking, which is even better.",

There is a parking lot, so it is convenient for those visiting by rental car or personal vehicle.\n\nHowever, since the parking lot is classified as small, parking may be insufficient during peak season or meal times. If possible, we recommend visiting during peak hours (lunch 12-1 PM, dinner 6-7 PM).\n\n【Tips for Use】\n1. Since takeout is also available, you can park, pack your food, and enjoy a picnic with Jeju Island's beautiful nature as a backdrop.\n\n2. We recommend checking the operating hours in advance before visiting. Since the operating hours are not clear at the moment, you can avoid wasted time by calling before visiting.\n\n3. There are many other tourist attractions nearby, so we recommend enjoying a quick croquette at Mitsukorokke and then exploring the nearby tourist attractions.\n\nWe hope you have a wonderful trip to Jeju with some crispy croquettes!",

Since Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, the area is also lively.\n\n**Recommended Second Round Places**\n\n1. **Yeondong Chicken Street (5-7 minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 500m\n - Hours: 5 PM - 2 AM\n - This is the closest late-night snack spot to Hanbit Guksu. After filling up on noodles, it's a great place to have a light meal of chicken or a beer. There are many chicken restaurants nearby, so there are plenty of options.\n\n2. **Jeju Beach Pojangmacha (10-minute walk)**\n - Distance: Approximately 800m\n - Hours: 6 PM - 3 AM\n - If you want to really feel the Jeju atmosphere, I recommend this place. It's a great place to have a glass of soju with raw fish and seafood snacks in the lively atmosphere of a pojangmacha. Hanbit Guksu is open until 4 AM, so you'll have plenty of time to spare even if you eat late.\n\n3. **Nohyeong Cafe Street (5-minute drive)**\n - Distance: Approximately 1.2km\n - Hours: 10 AM - Midnight\n - If you prefer dessert or tea rather than alcohol, I recommend Nohyeong Cafe Street. There are many cafes with nice atmospheres, so you can spend some leisurely time while taking in the night view. However, since most places are open until midnight, you need to check the hours.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Parking space is limited at Hanbit Guksu, so if you are considering a second round, we recommend using public transportation or a designated driver.\n- Yeondong area is the center of Jeju City, so it is relatively easy to catch a taxi even late at night.\n- There may be a wait at the second round location on weekends or during peak season, so it is a good idea to call in advance.\n- Hanbit Guksu's meat noodle soup and anchovy noodle soup (each 7,500 won) are generous in portions, so it would be better to plan a light second round.\n\nEnjoy the night of your trip to Jeju!",

    "reference": "Here's information on using the Seogwipo-si Donghong-dong Public Parking Lot!\n\n**Opening Hours**\nDonghong-dong Public Parking Lot is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so you can use it anytime. You can visit without worrying about parking, even in the early morning or late at night.\n\n**Parking Fee Information**\n- First 30 minutes: Free\n- Additional 30 minutes: 1,000 won\n- Maximum daily fee: 10,000 won (based on the same area)\n\nFor example, if you park for 3 hours, the first 30 minutes are free + 5 additional times (2 hours and 30 minutes) = 5,000 won. Even if you park all day, the maximum fee is 10,000 won, so it's not a burden even when sightseeing for a long time.\n\n**Fee Exemption Benefits**\nPeople with disabilities and veterans are exempt from parking fees. Those who are eligible should prepare the relevant documents, and since some parking lots are open for free during the holiday period, it is recommended to inquire in advance at Seogwipo City Hall.\n\n**Parking Lot Characteristics**\nSeogwipo City operates a total of 19 public parking lots, providing 903 parking spaces. Donghong-dong Parking Lot is particularly conveniently located as it is close to Seogwipo's major tourist attractions.\n\n**Precautions for Use**\nThis is an unmanned parking lot that uses a license plate recognition system. Please make sure that your license plate number is recognized correctly when entering and exiting. If the license plate is covered or damaged, it may not be recognized, so it is recommended to check in advance.\n\n**Pass Information**\nIf you wish to park long-term, we recommend using a pass. A season pass is much more economical than paying the daily maximum rate, so if you're planning a longer stay, inquire at Seogwipo City Hall.\n\n**Additional Tips**\nParking lots can fill up during peak tourist seasons and weekends, so we recommend arriving with plenty of time to spare. If the Donghong-dong parking lot is full, you can also use other public parking lots nearby.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your Seogwipo trip even more with our convenient parking service!",

    "reference": "Within 1km of the CU Jeju West Sea branch, you'll find a variety of restaurants serving Jeju's fresh seafood and local cuisine. We've selected five restaurants to choose from, so you can choose the one that best suits your taste.\n\n**Recommended restaurants in order of proximity**\n\n1. Jeju Traditional Restaurant (approximately a 4-minute walk, 0.3km)\nThis restaurant offers a taste of the freshness of Jeju's ocean. Its signature dishes include mackerel sashimi and braised cutlassfish, making it a popular spot for locals. If you're looking to experience traditional Jeju Korean cuisine, this is the first place to go.\n\n2. Ildo Haenyeo's House (approximately a 6-minute walk, 0.5km)\nHere, you can savor dishes made with fresh seafood harvested by haenyeo (female divers). Sea urchin soup and abalone porridge are particularly popular, but the restaurant also offers a variety of healthy dishes that showcase the rich flavors of Jeju's ocean.\n\n3.

As a result, there are many restaurants with reasonable prices and proven flavors. The Seohae Apartment bus stop is nearby, making it easily accessible by public transportation.\n\nLunchtime (12-1 PM) and dinnertime (6-7 PM) can be crowded with locals, so it's best to visit a little later for a more leisurely meal. Most restaurants are within a 10-minute walk, so you can conveniently walk to CU Jeju Seohae after purchasing your necessities.",

    "answer": "Yes, near the Woopi Hupi Geumneung branch, there are several cafes where you can enjoy coffee with a view of the ocean within walking distance. One popular option is **Café de Mocha**, which offers a cozy atmosphere and a lovely view of the sea. Another great choice is **O’sulloc Tea Museum Café**, where you can enjoy tea and coffee while overlooking the ocean and surrounding tea fields.\n\nIf you're looking for a more specific recommendation, I can help find cafes directly overlooking the beach or ocean in the Geumneung area. Would you like me to suggest some top-rated cafes with ocean views?",
    "reference": "Here are some great cafes where you can enjoy a cup of coffee while looking at the ocean after enjoying pizza at Woopi Hupi Geumneung!\n\n**Nearest Recommended Places**\n\n1. Geumneung Beach Cafe Street (about a 5-minute walk, 0.3km)\nThis is the area with the closest concentration of cafes to Woopi Hupi. Located right in front of Geumneung Beach, you can enjoy coffee while taking in the emerald Jeju ocean. Geumneung Beach is a representative beach on the west side of Jeju and is famous for its beautiful waters. There are many cafes here, so you can choose one that suits your taste.\n\n2. Hyeopjae Beach Cafe Street (about a 12-minute walk, 0.8km)\nThere are also various cafes and dessert shops around Hyeopjae Beach, located right next to Geumneung Beach. Hyeopjae is a bit larger and more lively than Geumneung. There are many cafes to choose from, and many offer views of Biyangdo Island.\n\n**Visit Tips**\n\n- Woopi Hupi Geumneung Branch is closed on Sundays, so we recommend visiting on Saturdays.\n- You can have pizza for lunch between 11:30 and 14:00, then take a leisurely stroll along the beach before visiting the cafe.\n- Geumneung and Hyeopjae Beach are also famous for their sunset views, so we recommend visiting in the afternoon.\n- Woopi Hupi has parking, but on a nice day, you can park your car and walk along the beach to find a cafe.\n\n**Suggested nearby courses**\n\nYou can spend half a day meaningfully by having lunch at Woopi Hupi → taking a stroll and cafe at Geumneung Beach → going to Hyeopjae Beach → watching the sunset. The two beaches are adjacent, so it is convenient to get to them, and it is the perfect place to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Jeju's west coast.",

The distance between these two locations is approximately 50 to 60 kilometers, depending on the specific route taken.\n\nBy car, it typically takes around 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes to travel from Seongsan Ilchulbong to Wangseobangnehakkobang. Travel time can vary depending on traffic conditions and the exact starting and ending points.\n\nWould you like directions or recommendations for your trip?",
    "reference": "The distance from Wangseobangnehakkkobang to Seongsan Ilchulbong is approximately 42.3km by car, and it takes about 50 minutes.\n\n**Travel Route Information**\n\nThe main travel routes are Provincial Roads 1132 and 97. This course starts from Seogwipo City and follows the eastern coastline, allowing you to enjoy the beautiful Jeju ocean scenery along the way.\n\n**Recommended Visit Schedule**\n\nWangseobangnehakkkobang opens at 10:00 AM, so it is recommended to have lunch between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM before heading to Seongsan Ilchulbong. If you leave around 1-1:30 PM after your meal, you can arrive at Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak around 2-2:30 PM.\n\nSeongsan Ilchulbong Peak is famous for its sunrise, but the view from the summit is also beautiful during the daytime. It takes about 1-1.5 hours round trip to the summit, so we recommend leaving plenty of time.\n\n**Notes and Tips**\n\nDuring peak tourist season (July-August, holiday periods), the roads may be congested, adding 10-15 minutes to the hike, so please plan your itinerary with plenty of time. Especially around Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, parking space is limited, so we recommend visiting early.\n\nWangseobangnehakkohbang also offers delivery and takeout, so if you're pressed for time, you can get it to go and eat it in your car or at the rest area near Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak.\n\nThere are beautiful spots like Pyoseon Beach and Seopjikoji along the way, so if you have time, stopping by for a bit will create good memories.",

It offers fresh seafood, including grilled fish and sashimi, and is known for its casual, welcoming atmosphere suitable for kids. The prices are reasonable, making it a good choice for a family outing.\n\nAlternatively, you might also consider **Seogwipo Maeil Olle Market**, where you can enjoy various seafood dishes at affordable prices, and kids can experience the lively market atmosphere.\n\nWould you like directions or more options?",
    "reference": "We've found two seafood restaurants perfect for dining with kids at the Southernmost Citrus Farm.\n\n**1. Namwon Sea Restaurant**\nLocation: Taewi-ro, Namwon-eup, Seogwipo-si (5-minute drive from the citrus farm)\nPrice range: 12,000-18,000 won per person\nSignature dishes: Sea urchin and seaweed soup, braised cutlassfish, seafood stew\n\nThis is the closest restaurant to the citrus farm, where you can enjoy traditional Jeju cuisine made with fresh seafood. The sea urchin and seaweed soup has a uniquely Jeju-style mild flavor, and the braised cutlassfish is easy on the stomach for children, making it a popular choice for families. The seafood stew is generously portioned, perfect for sharing between two adults and 1-2 children.\n\n**2. Wimi Port Haenyeo's House**\nLocation: Wimi-ri, Namwon-eup, Seogwipo-si (8 minutes by car from the tangerine farm)\nPrice range: 10,000-15,000 won per person\nSignature menu items: Sea urchin soup, abalone stew, seafood ramen\n\nThis place uses seafood caught by actual haenyeo, so the price is a little cheaper but the freshness is excellent. The abalone stew is nutritious because it contains whole abalone, and the seafood ramen is a menu that children especially like. Sea urchin soup is a special delicacy that can only be found in Jeju. It is rich and light without any fishy smell.\n\n**Recommended Visiting Tips**\n\nThere may be a wait during lunch time (12-1 PM), so finish your tangerine farm experience in the morning and head there around 11:30 AM, or visit after 1:30 PM to enjoy a leisurely meal.\n\nBoth locations have parking and provide high chairs and cutlery, making it convenient for families. If you have children with seafood allergies, please let us know in advance and we will recommend an alternative menu.\n\nNamwon is located on the southern coast of Jeju, so its seafood is especially fresh, and you can enjoy meals at local prices rather than tourist prices. After your tangerine farm experience, experience the fresh flavors of Jeju's sea with your hungry children.",

    "reference": "A 2-night, 3-day couple's trip at Noeuldamda Pension would be so romantic! Here's the budget breakdown, excluding airfare.\n\n**Total Budget: Approximately 450,000 won to 650,000 won**\n\nHere's a detailed budget breakdown:\n\n**1. Accommodation (180,000 won to 300,000 won)**\nNoeuldamda is an ocean view pension located in Dongbok-ri, Gujwa-eup. A double room is expected to cost approximately 90,000 won to 150,000 won per night. Prices may vary depending on peak/off-peak seasons, so we recommend inquiring directly. Since these rooms have a beautiful ocean view, it might be better to book a room by the window.\n\n**2. Food (180,000 won to 240,000 won)**\nIf you're looking to enjoy some local Jeju restaurants, around 30,000 won per person per day should be enough. Gujwa-eup has many places with fresh and delicious seafood. It's a good idea to have breakfast at a cafe near the pension, and lunch and dinner at nearby restaurants. Gujwa-eup is especially famous for its restaurants, such as Sea Urchin and Seaweed Soup and Haenyeo's House.\n\n**3. Transportation (50,000 won - 70,000 won)**\nRental car is the most convenient way to travel around Jeju. A compact car costs about 30,000 won per day, which is about 90,000 won for 3 days, but if two people share, it's about 45,000 won per person. Public transportation is cheaper, but since public transportation in Gujwa-eup is not very convenient, we recommend renting a car.\n\n**4. Activities and Sightseeing (Around 40,000 won)**\nThere are many free beach walks and sunrise/sunset spots around Noeuldamda. Additionally, if you plan to visit nearby tourist attractions or participate in experience programs, you can expect to pay around 20,000 won per person.\n\n**Frugal Travel Tips:**\n\n- The ocean view is amazing, so enjoy the time you spend at the pension. Don't miss the sunset in particular.\n- Woljeong-ri Beach and Gimnyeong Beach near Gujwa-eup are free attractions.\n- You can save on food by buying simple snacks and drinks at local supermarkets.\n- Accommodation is 20-30% cheaper if you visit during the off-season (November to February, excluding summer vacation season).\n\nIf you plan at a moderate level, you will be able to enjoy a comfortable and leisurely trip without any problems. If it's a special anniversary, you can consider adding an additional budget (around 100,000 won) for one meal at a high-end restaurant!",

It's a small space that can accommodate 3-4 passenger cars and is available on a first-come, first-served basis. There's no additional parking fee, so feel free to use it.\n\n**Nearby Alternative Parking Lot**\nIf the guesthouse's parking lot is full, don't worry.

While this public parking lot does require a fee, its central location makes it a reasonable price.\n\n**Parking Tips**\nDuring peak travel seasons and weekends, parking may be limited. Since the guesthouse is typically used by multiple guests at the same time, we recommend inquiring about parking availability with the guesthouse before check-in.

    "answer": "Yeondong, Jeju City, is known for its vibrant nightlife and excellent seafood options. For late-night fresh seafood, especially dishes like octopus stew and abalone sashimi, I recommend visiting **Jeju Noodle Street** area, which has several seafood restaurants that stay open late.\n\nOne highly recommended place is **Seogwipo Haenyeo House** (서귀포 해녀의집), which offers fresh seafood caught by Jeju's famous haenyeo (female divers). They serve dishes like octopus stew and abalone sashimi, and some locations are open late into the night.\n\nAnother option is **Dongmun Fish Market** (동문시장), which is a lively market where you can enjoy freshly prepared seafood dishes. Many vendors and small restaurants around the market stay open until late, offering octopus dishes and abalone.\n\n**Tip:** For the freshest experience, look for restaurants that have live seafood tanks, and don't hesitate to ask if they can prepare dishes like octopus stew or abalone sashimi for late-night dining.\n\nWould you like specific restaurant names or addresses?",

    "answer": "Certainly! If you're staying near Jeju Eoulda Pension in Hallim-eup and want to buy barbecue ingredients, here are some transportation options:\n\n1. **Car Rental:**  \n   Renting a car is the most convenient way to travel around Jeju, especially for shopping and exploring. Many rental agencies operate near Jeju Airport or in Hallim-eup. You can pick up a rental car and drive directly to local markets or grocery stores.\n\n2. **Local Markets and Grocery Stores:**  \n   - **Jeju Traditional Market (Jeju Dongmun Market):** Located in Jeju City, about 30-40 minutes drive from Hallim-eup. It offers fresh seafood, meat, and local produce.  \n   - **Hallim Market:** A smaller local market closer to your location, suitable for quick shopping.  \n   - **Supermarkets:** E-Mart, Lotte Mart, or Homeplus are available in Jeju City or Seogwipo, offering a wide selection of ingredients.\n\n3. **Public Transportation:**  \n   - **Bus:** Jeju has a well-developed bus system. You can take a bus from Hallim-eup to Jeju City or Seogwipo to visit markets. Check the local bus schedules for routes and timings.  \n   - **Taxi:** Taxis are available and can be a convenient option if you prefer direct transportation without renting a car.\n\n4. **Directions from Hallim-eup:**  \n   - To reach Jeju Traditional Market, head east on local roads toward Jeju City. The drive takes around 30-40 minutes.  \n   - For local markets, ask your accommodation or rental agency for the best routes.\n\nWould you like specific recommendations for markets or grocery stores near your location?",
    "reference": "You're headed to Jeju Eoulda Pension to buy barbecue ingredients! A rental car will make your trip very convenient.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nJeju Eoulda is located in Hyeopjae-ri, Hallim-eup. It's about 3.2km from downtown Hallim-eup. A rental car will get you there in about 7-10 minutes. From Hyeopjae Beach, take Route 1100 and head toward Hallim Market. The route isn't complicated, so just follow the navigation and you'll find it without difficulty.\n\n**Recommended Places to Buy BBQ Ingredients**\nThere are three main places I recommend for buying barbecue ingredients.\n\nHallim Market is the best choice. Here, you can buy Jeju specialties, fresh seafood, and vegetables at reasonable prices. Enjoying a barbecue with Jeju pork or fresh seafood will be an even more special experience. The market offers free parking, so you can shop without worrying about parking.\n\nIf you need simple ingredients, drinks, or sauces, you can also visit E-Mart 24 Hallim or GS25 Hyeopjae. Hyeopjae is closer to the pension and has parking right in front, making it a great place to quickly grab what you need.\n\n**Parking and Usage Tips**\nHallim Market offers free parking, so you can use it without any hassle. However, parking can be limited during peak summer season and on weekends, so we recommend visiting in the morning if possible. There's also the advantage of being able to purchase fresher ingredients if you go in the morning.\n\nIf you use the convenience store, you can use the parking space in front of the store, but since there isn't much space, if you have a passenger, it's a good idea for one person to get off first and shop.\n\n**Information on Using Jeju Eoulda Barbecue**\nJeju Eoulda has a well-equipped barbecue area, making it the perfect place to enjoy a barbecue party while feeling the cool Jeju breeze in the evening. Since it's a private pension, you can enjoy it comfortably without worrying about other guests, and it's the perfect environment to make special memories with family or friends.\n\nAfter buying ingredients, we also recommend stopping by Hyeopjae Beach on the way back. The beach is right nearby, so take a walk around sunset, return to the pension, and start a barbecue for the perfect Jeju trip!",

The course meal takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, so if you have plans later, we recommend making a reservation with plenty of time. The romantic atmosphere and meticulous interior design will make your special evening even more special.\n\nWhen making a reservation, check the course meal time and parking availability to ensure an even more perfect dinner!",

    "answer": "Certainly! Renting a car from Dahan House to Mt. Halla is a convenient way to explore Jeju. Here are some transportation tips:\n\n1. **Rental Car Options:**  \n   - Many rental companies operate near Dahan House or in Jeju City. You can choose from popular providers like Lotte Rent-a-Car, SK Rent-a-Car, or local agencies.  \n   - Make sure to book in advance, especially during peak seasons.\n\n2. **Driving Directions:**  \n   - The distance from Dahan House to Mt. Halla (Hallasan) is approximately 30-40 km, depending on your starting point.  \n   - The most common route is via the Jeju International Airport or Jeju City, taking the local roads or expressways.  \n   - The drive typically takes around 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\n3. **Navigation:**  \n   - Use GPS or navigation apps like Naver Map or Kakao Map, which are reliable in Korea.  \n   - Search for \"Hallasan\" or \"Hallasan National Park\" as your destination.\n\n4. **Parking & Access:**  \n   - There are parking facilities near the Hallasan trailheads, especially at the Seongpanak and Gwaneumsa trail entrances.  \n   - Be mindful of parking fees and regulations.\n\n5. **Additional Tips:**  \n   - Check the weather forecast before heading up, as mountain roads can be affected by weather conditions.  \n   - If you're planning to hike, ensure your vehicle is parked securely and follow park guidelines.\n\nWould you like recommendations for specific rental agencies, or information about the best trails and viewpoints at Mt. Halla?",
    "reference": "You're planning to rent a car from The White House to Hallasan! Here's some detailed transportation information.\n\n**Basic Transportation Information**\nThe distance from Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, where The White House is located, to the entrance of the Hallasan Trail is approximately 28-32km, and it takes about 40-50 minutes by rental car. It's a great course to drive while enjoying the beautiful mid-mountainous scenery of Jeju Island.\n\n**Recommended Route**\nStart from Andeok-myeon and head north on Road 1131 (Sanroknam-ro). Then, take Road 1100 (Hallasan Through Road) to reach the entrance of the Hallasan Trail. Route 1100 is one of Jeju's most beautiful drives, offering stunning scenery year-round.\n\n**Parking Information**\nHallasan offers free parking at Eorimok Parking Lot and Yeongsil Parking Lot. The parking lots are conveniently located within walking distance of each trail entrance. However, parking lots can fill up during peak season and weekends, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\nHallasan is subject to extremely unpredictable weather conditions. Before departing, always check the Hallasan National Park website or call to confirm trail openings. Trails may be closed due to weather conditions such as strong winds, heavy rain, or heavy snow. Furthermore, even if it's sunny at the base of the mountain, the weather near the summit can be quite different, so it's recommended to bring warm clothing or a raincoat.\n\n**Driving Precautions**\nRoute 1100 is a winding mountain road, so safe driving is essential. Visibility can be particularly limited in fog or rain, so slow down and turn on your headlights. Roads can also be icy in winter, so be especially careful.\n\nIf you leave Dahayan House early in the morning, you can finish your Hallasan climb and visit nearby Hyeopjae Beach or Andeok Valley in the afternoon, making for a fulfilling day. We wish you a safe and enjoyable trip to Hallasan!",

    "reference": "The area around Cafe Bom Bom Andeok Hwasun is filled with Jeju's beautiful natural attractions. Here are some great spots to visit after enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee.\n\n**Nearest Recommended Courses**\n\n1. **Hwasun Golden Sand Beach (1.2km)**\nHwasun Golden Sand Beach, located closest to the cafe, is a beautiful beach representing southwestern Jeju. The golden sand and clear, emerald waters create a fantastic landscape. Grab a sweet potato latte or green grape ade to-go from the cafe and take a stroll along the beach. Strolling along the beach will allow you to fully experience Jeju's relaxed atmosphere.\n\n2. **Sanbangsan Mountain (2.8km)**\nApproximately 3km from the cafe, Sanbangsan Mountain is an iconic volcano in Jeju, known for its unique shape. Perched on a mountainside, Sanbanggulsa Temple is a unique temple housing a Buddhist statue within a natural cave. The spiritual atmosphere and breathtaking views of the South Sea from the summit are truly captivating. If the hike isn't your thing, the view from the base of the mountain is equally impressive.\n\n3. **Yongmeori Coast (3.5km)**\nFormed by volcanic activity tens of millions of years ago, the Yongmeori Coast is a landmark showcasing Jeju's unique geological treasures. The rock formations resemble a dragon entering the sea, earning it its name. The breathtaking scenery, created by layered volcanic ash strata and waves, is a testament to the majesty of nature. However, please note that access may be restricted depending on the tide, so check before visiting.\n\n4. **Songaksan Mountain (4.2km)**\nSongaksan Mountain, with its 99 peaks, boasts a well-maintained, gentle walking trail, making it ideal for a leisurely hike. Climbing to the summit offers panoramic views of Marado Island, Gapado Island, and Hallasan Mountain. Especially if you visit around sunset, you can see the spectacular view of Jeju's sea turning golden.\n\n**Recommended Route**\n\nAfter enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee at Cafe Bom Bom in the morning, we recommend taking a walk at Hwasun Golden Sand Beach, and visiting either Sanbangsan Mountain or Yongmeori Coast in the afternoon. If you have time, ending the day by watching the sunset at Songaksan Mountain is a perfect course.\n\nAndeok-myeon is a hidden gem of Jeju, and with relatively few tourists, you can enjoy sightseeing leisurely. Cafe Bom Bom is open until 10 PM, so it is a great way to end the day by stopping by again after sightseeing and enjoying an evening coffee.",

    "answer": "Of course! Kimgun Village Guesthouse is located in Jeju City, and there are several interesting attractions nearby that you can explore on foot. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Dongmun Traditional Market**  \n   - A lively market where you can experience local food, fresh produce, and souvenirs. It's about a 10-minute walk from the guesthouse.\n\n2. **Jeju Folklore & Natural History Museum**  \n   - Offers insights into Jeju's culture, history, and natural environment. Approximately a 15-minute walk away.\n\n3. **Tapdong Promenade**  \n   - A scenic waterfront area perfect for a leisurely stroll, enjoying views of the ocean and local street performances. It's within walking distance, roughly 10 minutes from the guesthouse.\n\n4. **Jeju Yongyeon Pond**  \n   - A peaceful pond with beautiful scenery, especially lovely at sunset. About a 15-minute walk.\n\nWould you like more detailed directions or information about any of these spots?",
    "reference": "Kimgun Village Guesthouse is surrounded by many wonderful tourist attractions within walking distance. Its proximity to the coast, Yongdamsam-dong, Jeju City, makes it an ideal location for enjoying the natural scenery.\n\n**Nearby Attractions Within Walking Distance**\n\n1. Yongdam Coastal Road (approximately 500m, 6-minute walk)\nThis is the closest attraction to the guesthouse. This coastal path follows the Jeju sea, and the sunset is particularly breathtaking. While the view from the guesthouse terrace is beautiful, there's something special about walking along the coastal path and feeling the sea breeze.\n\n2. Yongduam Rock (approximately 1.2km, 15-minute walk)\nThis is one of Jeju's most iconic landmarks, a striking rock formation resembling a dragon's head. It's a great place for an early morning stroll, and the surrounding photo zones are perfect for commemorative photos. There are many local restaurants around Yongduam Rock, making it a great place to take a quick stroll after breakfast.\n\n3. Yongyeon Cloud Bridge (approximately 1.8 km, 22-minute walk)\nThis bridge offers a panoramic view of Yongyeon's beautiful scenery. If you don't mind walking a little more, this is a highly recommended course. The view of Yongyeon from the cloud bridge will be the highlight of your Jeju trip.\n\n**Recommended Course**\n\nAfter breakfast provided by the guesthouse, we recommend taking a leisurely stroll along the Yongdam Coastal Road to Yongduam Rock. The total round trip takes about an hour, but if you take time to take photos and enjoy the ocean, you can easily spend about 2 hours there.\n\nIf you are confident in your stamina, you can also continue to Yongyeon Cloud Bridge. However, it can get hot in the afternoon, so we recommend leaving early in the morning.\n\n**Practical Tips**\n\n- Since the guesthouse offers an ocean view, most of the surrounding tourist attractions are located along the coast.\n- The coastal road is flat and easy to walk, but a hat and sunscreen are essential to block the sun.\n- The scenery of Yongduam Rock changes depending on the tide, so it is better to check the low tide time before going.\n- If you are staying in a women-only room, it is convenient to get ready to go out in the powder room before leaving.\n- There are many local restaurants nearby, so we recommend having lunch near the tourist attraction.\n\nThe guesthouse is conveniently located near the main tourist attractions in Jeju City, so you can easily see many attractions on foot. Enjoy a leisurely trip to Jeju by slowly exploring the surrounding attractions while relaxing in a comfortable accommodation.",
