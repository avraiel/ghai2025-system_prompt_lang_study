              "   'explanation': 'The user asked for the distance from Petrichor Jeju to Gureumri Beach and whether walking there with children is feasible. The reference states the distance is about 350 meters (about 5 minutes on foot) and is easily walkable with children. The answer, however, claims a driving distance of 12.3 km (1 hour 15 minutes) and centers on a car-based itinerary, which contradicts the reference and misleads about the walking option. The response also contains repetitive, non-essential details and lacks consistency in place naming. To improve, the answer should state the correct walking distance/time (≈350 m, ~5 minutes), explicitly confirm walking with children is feasible, and only include driving details if the user asks for them, keeping terminology consistent (Gureumri/Gueomri).'}}}"
